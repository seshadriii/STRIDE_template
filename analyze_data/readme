Variables/Columns available in the raw data set
1. Unique serial number of a vehicle
2. Vehicle type (vehicle classes, light, medium or heavy)
3. Trip origin Transporation Analysis Zone aka TAZ (total of 7000 unique TAZ)
4. Trip Destination Transportation Analysis Zone (total of 7000 unique TAZ)
5. Trip Purpose
6. Trip start and end times
7. Stoppage/parking time between trips
8. Missing yet, the actual trip distance (working on getting it as it is the most useful and important variable)

Since the raw data has both spatial and temporal elements, I will first focus on the temporal aspects before moving on to the spatial aspects.

Phase 1 of analysis
1. Get summary statistics by groups (vehicle, purpose): number of trips and trip distance. Plus other combinations depending on time of day, 
trip origin and destination purpose
2. Distributions/density plots: Identify opportunities where a vehicle can potentially refuel assuming a cut off of 30 minute parking time
3. Get the count/number of vehicles that stop for more than 30 minutes by TAZ level

Phase 2 of analysis
Assuming I have the trip distances estimated 
1. Repeat the summary statistics with trip distances
2. Assume a cut off of 200 miles , this is the range a vehicle can travel on battery or hydrogen
3. Identify vehicle trips and tours that meet the criterion of total tour (aggregate sum of individual trips) distance of 200 miles or less
4. Convert the distance traveled into energy consumption in kWh or cuft of hydrogen, this is the energy demand

Phase 3 of analysis
Mainly spatial aspects
1. Create heat maps for TAZ that have high density of trips starting or ending
2. Create heat maps for TAZ by parking duration and the energy demand at the end of each trip
3. Use shape files to depict how this energy demand and parking durations varies within a day or pick the top 10 hot spots to show where more
refueling infrastructure is needed
